# AIrbnb_Berlin-Project

Project motivation:

Project aims and background
Airbnb is a home-sharing platform that allows home-owners and renters (‘hosts’) to put their properties (‘listings’) online, so that guests can pay to stay in them.

It allows you , for example, to rent out your home for a week while you’re away, or rent out your empty bedroom. One challenge that Airbnb hosts face is determining the optimal nightly rent price.

Airbnb pricing is important to get right, even small differences in prices can make a big difference. Not to price too high and not to price too low is a challenge and I will try to help you to get better understanding of key price drivers as well as get idea what is your unit market worth.

This analysis is all about how to best price Airbnb accommodation and increase your monthly earnings.

  <br> Q1. Which Airbnb listings earn the most in Berlin?
  <br> Q2. What Characteristics (Features) impact the price of Airnbnb listing in Berlin the most? 
  <br> Q3. What highly rated neighbourhoods in Berlin have to offer ? Whhat description of highly priced places tell the customer?
  <br> Q4. What are those extraordinary highly profitable units and what makes them triple their monthly earnings in comparison to the rest nicely located listings? 

Main Goal: to practice analysing and wrangling real-worl data and writing Post in Medium as a result of Analysis.

Description: A case study using Airbnb data from the City of Berlin, Germany as part of the project for Udacity DS course.

In this project I'm going to apply CRISP-DM(CRoss Industry Standard Process Data mining) which contains 6 steps:

Business Undestanding.
Data Understanding.
Preparing Data.
Data Modeling.
Evaluate Results.
Deployment.


Project files:
1. Jupyter Notebook with Wrangling , EDA, Modeling and  Visualization of  key resuts
2. data files for the project in data folder
3. requirenments.txt

Conclusion:

By using  Statistics Analysis helped to generate valuable data-driven solutions/suggestions  for uplifting price for a rental unite, which are applicable for different types of an audience - from big investors, as well as flt owners and those who would like to get some extra cash while away from a town by renting one of the rooms.
XGBoost modeling helped generate valuable insights what else apart from location and type of accomodation can help you increase your earnings. Accuracy of XGBoost model overperformed simple Linear Regression model.
Geomaps helped present the result in interactive and engaging way and show avg price per area on an map.
And finally WordCloud algorythms could help generate understanding about the most desirable and at the same time highly priced places for which visitor glad to pay. 


And finally as a result of this project, I've written post on medium https://medium.com/p/d84a36d86fb0/edit . Enjoy reading!
