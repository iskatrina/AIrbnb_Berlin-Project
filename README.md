# AIrbnb_Berlin-Project

Project motivation:

Project aims and background
Airbnb is a home-sharing platform that allows home-owners and renters (‘hosts’) to put their properties (‘listings’) online, so that guests can pay to stay in them.

It allows you , for example, to rent out your home for a week while you’re away, or rent out your empty bedroom. One challenge that Airbnb hosts face is determining the optimal nightly rent price.

Airbnb pricing is important to get right, even small differences in prices can make a big difference. Not to price too high and not to price too low is a challenge and I will try to help you to get better understanding of key price drivers as well as get idea what is your unit market worth.

This analysis is all about how to best price Airbnb accommodation and increase your monthly earnings.

### Q1. Which Airbnb listings earn the most in Berlin?
### Q2. What Characteristics (Features) impact the price of Airnbnb listing in Berlin the most? 
### Q3. What highly rated neighbourhoods in Berlin have to offer ? Whhat description of highly priced places tell the customer?
### Q4. What are those extraordinary highly profitable units and what makes them triple their monthly earnings in comparison to the rest nicely located listings? 

Main Goal: to practice analysing and wrangling real-worl data and writing Post in Medium as a result of Analysis.

Description: A case study using Airbnb data from the City of Berlin, Germany as part of the project for Udacity DS course.

In this project I'm going to apply CRISP-DM(CRoss Industry Standard Process Data mining) which contains 6 steps:

Business Undestanding.
Data Understanding.
Preparing Data.
Data Modeling.
Evaluate Results.
Deployment.


Project files:
1. Jupyter Notebook with Wrangling , EDA, Modeling and  Visualization of  key resuts
2. data files for the project in data folder

And finally as a result of this project, I've written [post on medium](https://medium.com/@kateisaieva/using-ml-prediction-to-maximise-income-with-airbnb-d84a36d86fb0). Enjoy!
